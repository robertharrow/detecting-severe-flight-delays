    "# Predicting Major Flight Delays\n",
    "\n",
    "Our client, FlightChicken, would like a model that predicts whether a flight will experience a major delay. Delays can cause a major disruption to travel plans, especially if they cause a person to miss their connecting flight. FlightChicken would like to give their users a heads up about potential travel disruptions like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a major undertaking as there are hundreds of airlines and thousands of airports in the United States alone. That's why FlightChicken would like to launch with just an MVP to prove our their concept. This MVP should support major US airports and 8 of the most popular airlines."

    "6. On the results page, find the closest/most relevant weather station. In the example of \"Atlanta, GA airport\" you would select 'Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport\".
